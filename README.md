# Jigsaw-Puzzle
This project is my take on a typical jigsaw puzzle game in that this version gets a new image from Bing each day and creates identical rectangular pieces to play.
# Motivation
As a kid I enjoyed playing jigsaw puzzles. Having grown up, I wanted easy access to play jigsaw puzzles with a fresh puzzle daily. All the other jigsaw puzzle games online didn't look enticing to my vision. I also wanted a challenge as the original jigsaw puzzle games would make specific pieces for the edges instead of uniform shaped pieces all around.
